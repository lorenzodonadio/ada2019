    "\n",
    "The data you'll be working with comes from multiple sources. The main data source will be [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/), a database of publications from major computer science journals and conferences. A subset of DBLP, which you will use in this assignment, is provided to you via a [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kci8joML74tCSzuBbhxtd1ylR4f0dlm6/view). Later on, you will enrich the DBLP data with a dataset on conference rankings and with the proceedings of the [NIPS conference](https://nips.cc/) [1] ('proceedings' is another word for the set of papers published at an academic conference). After loading and cleaning the data, you will answer various questions about its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some rules:**\n",
    "- You are allowed to use any built-in Python library that comes with Anaconda. If you want to use an external library, you have to justify your choice.\n",
    "- Make sure you use the data folder provided in the repository in *read-only* mode.\n",
    "- Be sure to provide explanations for your answers. A notebook that only has code cells will not suffice.\n",
    "- Also, be sure to *hand in a fully-run and evaluated notebook*. We will not run your notebook for you, we will grade it as is, which means that only the results contained in your evaluated code cells will be considered, and we will not see the results in unevaluated code cells. In order to check whether everything looks as intended, you can check the rendered notebook on the GitHub website once you have pushed your solution there.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] Note that NIPS was renamed to NeurIPS in 2018, but for simplicity, whenever we say 'NIPS', we really mean 'NIPS and NeurIPS'."

    "### A1. Loading the data\n",
    "Download the DBLP dataset (available on [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kci8joML74tCSzuBbhxtd1ylR4f0dlm6/view)) and load it into a Pandas dataframe. A row of your dataframe should look as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Filter the papers: keep only conference papers. For each of the remaining ones, find the acronym of the conference where it was published. Retain only those papers that have been published in the conferences listed in `data/list_of_ai_conferences.txt`. Additionally, add a column named 'conference' to your dataframe.   \n",
    "_Hint: The `paper id` tells you whether a paper was published at a conference, and if so, at which one._\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Report the overall number of papers in the filtered dataset, as well as the number of papers per conference."

Real-world data is usually messy, with typos, erroneous entries, and sometimes issues that make even loading the data problematic.

In particular, let’s focus on the two major ML conferences, NIPS and ICML: make a new dataframe with only NIPS and ICML papers (let’s call these the “ML papers”), plot the number of ML papers over time, and analyze and discuss the plot. Do you observe anything odd in this plot? What causes these problems?   \n",

After this step, remove any remaining papers that have missing values. Redo the plots of steps A3.2 and A3.3 after fixing the issue.   \n",
